# Photo Editing Website

## Project Overview
This is a **Photo Editing Website** that consists of a frontend built with React and a backend running on Node.js. The frontend allows users to upload, edit, and manage images, while the backend handles API requests and stores necessary data.

### Backend (`api` folder)
- Runs on **Node.js**.
- Contains the server-side logic for handling API requests.
- Manages image uploads, storage, and any database interactions.

### Frontend (`photoeditorc` folder)
- Built using **React** with **Redux** for state management.
- Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Firebase is integrated (`firebase.js`) for authentication and/or storage.
- Redux store and slices are defined in the `redux` folder.
- Assets, components, and pages are organized within the `src` directory.
